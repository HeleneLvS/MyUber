# MyUber
I recently requested my trip data from Uber. Unfortunately it didn't include the whole list of trips, but at least the results included trips across countries of the EMEA region that I took over an 18 month period.
I didn't know what I wanted to do with the data except maybe just compare the different experiences across the three regions I had exposure in.
So, here is my anecdotal analysis of my Uber trips and the bottom line:

*If you're me, never get an Uber on a Thursday...*
